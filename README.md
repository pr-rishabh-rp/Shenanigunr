✭ 'Sup, its @pr-rishabh-rp.
✭ I’m interested in computer science, machine learning and making this world a better place for the next generation, or at least preserve it as it is.
✭ I’m currently learning to code; C++ and Python are one of my first languages. I can do basic coding but I have little confidence in it, but my passion shines on like a crazy diamond.
✭ I'm looking to collaborate in projects with people I respect, genres I admire and fields I find worthwhile. If I am in, you'll get my best else nothing.
✭ How to reach me? I have a Linkedin account that I don't use: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishabhrp. Email me @ official-for-parmar@hotmail.com.
✭ :) I hope you have a good day.
